Project Definition
Write a small Spring Boot application that will ingest the following claim data JSON and expose them via a REST API.
The API should be able support the following operations:
Finding all claims
Getting a claim by its ID
Finding all claims matching a given insuredID
Other requirements:
The code should be as close to production-grade as possible
Donâ€™t assume the claims JSON will always come as files, in the future we might want to support reading them from a DB or from an external source.
The project is estimated at 4-5h of work. If you think anything is not clear of if you have any questions you can email Andy  andy@decent.com.
